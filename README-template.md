## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) - CSS architecture

### What I learned

I used this project to practice my layout skills with flexbox. I used these opportunity to learn and practice the use of a CSS preprocessor Sass. Although this is a small component, I also wanted to use the BEM methodology to practice it and see if I like it.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to keep practicing Sass and learn more advance features that can help me speed up the process.
